# Simple Shell Project

This is a collaborative project for the ALX Software Engineering School, where we are building a simple shell, also known as a command-line interpreter. This shell is designed to mimic some of the basic functionalities of a Unix shell, such as executing commands, managing processes, and handling input/output.

## Team Members

## Features

Our simple shell project currently supports the following features:

- Command execution
- Path resolution
- Basic built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `exit`)
- Handling of command arguments
- Redirection of standard input and output
- Pipelining of commands

## How to Use

To use our simple shell, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]

a). Compile the shell project

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

b).Run the shell project.

./hsh

c). You can now enter commands just like you would in a standard Unix shell.

Examples
Here are some examples of how to use our shell:

Running a command

$ ls -l

d). Changing the working directory:

bash
Copy code
$ cd /path/to/directory
Exiting the shell:

bash
Copy code
$ exit
